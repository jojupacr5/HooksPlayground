# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

With this project I try almost all hooks that are being provide by React, play a litle with them so I can understand their functionality and use it, if needed, in any other projects.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
